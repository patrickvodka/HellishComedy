 HellishComedy is a 2D game that explores the different levels of hell. The main character is a fallen angel who finds himself at the bottom and aims to ascend to the top to reach paradise. 
The player can move, jump, attack, and perform one dash as long as they haven't touched the ground. When a dash is used, the angel's golden wings turn purple. If, while the wings are purple, the player kills a creature, the dash is reset.

This game combines elements of Jump King and is also inspired by Celeste for its jump complexity and the skills required to perform double, triple, or quadruple dashes.
 If the player is hit by a monster or a bullet, the game blocks inputs for a few seconds, forcing them to slide to one side and fall.
